You can export your prompt to an image which you can share online. You have the ability to align
it correctly and add your name for credits too.

:::caution
Some glyphs aren't rendered correctly, that's not you but the limitations of the renderer.
Depending on your config, you might have to tweak the output a little bit.
:::

The oh-my-posh executable has the `config export image` command to export your current theme configuration
to a PNG image file (if no other options are specified this will be the name of the config file, or `prompt.png`).

```powershell
oh-my-posh config export image
```

There are a couple of additional flags you can use to tweak the image rendering:

- `--author`: the name of the creator, added after `ohmyposh.dev`
- `--background-color`: the hex background color to use (e.g. `#222222`)
- `--output`: the file to export to (e.g. `mytheme.png`)

For all options, and additional examples, use `oh-my-posh config export image --help`
